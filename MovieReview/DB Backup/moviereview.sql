One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country. In 1992, Wakandas King TChaka visits his brother NJobu, who is working undercover in Oakland, California. TChaka accuses NJobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. NJobus partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms TChakas suspicions.</p>\r\n<p>In the present day, following TChakas death,[N 1] his son TChalla returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye, the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract TChallas ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribes leader MBaku challenges TChalla for the crown in ritual combat. TChalla defeats MBaku and persuades him to yield rather than die.</p>\r\n<p>When Klaue and Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, TChallas friend and Okoyes lover WKabi urges him to bring Klaue back alive. TChalla, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross. A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by TChalla, who reluctantly releases him to Ross custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakandas international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, TChalla takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.</p>\r\n<p>While Shuri heals Ross, TChalla confronts Zuri about NJobu. Zuri explains that NJobu planned to share Wakandas technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As TChaka arrested NJobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced TChaka to kill him. TChaka ordered Zuri to lie that NJobu had disappeared and left behind NJobus American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. black ops soldier who adopted the name \"Killmonger\". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges TChalla to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats TChalla, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by WKabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.</p>\r\n<p>Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose TChalla, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing MBakus life. Healed by Nakias herb, TChalla returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. WKabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. MBaku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce TChalla. Confronted by Okoye, WKabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakandas vibranium mine, TChalla disrupts Killmongers suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.</p>\r\n<p>TChalla establishes an outreach center at the building where NJobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, TChalla appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakandas true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his recuperation.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/BlackPanther.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxWvtMOGAhw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 1346898686),

As they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk, and kills Loki. Heimdall sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifr&ouml;st before being killed. Thanos departs with his lieutenants and obliterates the ship.</p>\r\n<p>Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos plan to kill half of all life in the universe; in response, Strange recruits Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Maw captures Strange, but fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment. Stark and Parker pursue Maws spaceship, Banner contacts Steve Rogers, and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.</p>\r\n<p>In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Visions forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself by having Maximoff destroy the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision.</p>\r\n<p>The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, who surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, where they and Eitri create a battle-axe capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter, who reveals the location of the Soul Stone to save her captive adoptive sister Nebula from torture. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull, keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos reluctantly kills Gamora, earning the stone.</p>\r\n<p>Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. Landing on Titan, they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos Infinity Gauntlet after Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plans as necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. The group subdues him until Nebula deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks him, allowing Thanos to break the groups hold and overpower them. Stark is seriously wounded by Thanos, but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos.</p>\r\n<p>In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos army invades. The Avengers, alongside TChalla and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner, unable to transform into the Hulk, fights in Starks Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed and their army is routed. Thanos arrives and despite Maximoffs attempt to destroy the Mind Stone, removes it from Vision, killing him.</p>\r\n<p>Thor severely wounds Thanos, but Thanos activates the completed Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.</p>\r\n<p>In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fianc&eacute; Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Roses marriage will resolve their familys financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.</p>\r\n<p>Aware of Cal and Ruths disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jacks advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cals engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cals bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.</p>\r\n<p>Cal discovers Jacks sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jacks pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the master-at-arms office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.</p>\r\n<p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguards pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.</p>\r\n<p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of hypothermia but Rose is saved.</p>\r\n<p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Roses story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean &mdash; in her possession all along &mdash; and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed, photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanics Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/Titanic.jpg', '<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2e-eXJ6HgkQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 2147483647),

Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought, but after the Resistance escapes to hyperspace, the First Order tracks them and attacks the Resistance convoy. Kylo Ren, Leias son, hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mothers presence, but his TIE fighter wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of their leadership and incapacitating Leia, who survives by using the Force. Disapproving of new leader Vice Admiral Holdos passive strategy, Poe helps Finn, BB-8, and mechanic Rose Tico embark on a secret mission to disable the First Orders tracking device.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Rey arrives on Ahch-To with Chewbacca and R2-D2 aboard the Millennium Falcon to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Disillusioned by his failure to train Kylo as a Jedi, and under self-imposed exile from the Force, Luke refuses to help &ndash; even after he learns of Han Solos death at Kylos hands &ndash; and believes that the Jedi should become extinct. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo communicate through the Force, puzzling the two enemies. As Rey and Kylo learn about each other, each has future visions of themselves as partners.</p>\r\n<p>R2-D2 persuades Luke to train Rey. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side of the Force, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Supreme Leader Snoke was corrupting him, causing Kylo to destroy Lukes new Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To without Luke. Luke prepares to burn the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but hesitates. Yodas ghost appears and destroys the temple by summoning a bolt of lightning, claiming Rey has all she needs to learn, and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.</p>\r\n<p>Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions cowardly and risky, Poe leads a mutiny. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 travel to the Canto Bight casino and acquire the help of the hacker DJ. They infiltrate Snokes ship, where all but BB-8 are captured by Captain Phasma. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who claims that he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats Snokes guards alongside Rey. Rey believes that Kylo has returned to the light side of the Force, but he instead invites her to rule the galaxy with him, which she refuses. They use the Force to fight for possession of Anakin Skywalkers lightsaber, which splits in two.</p>\r\n<p>Leia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snokes fleet as the others flee to an abandoned Rebel Alliance base on Crait. DJ reveals the Resistances plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snokes fleet at lightspeed; Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Phasma, and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw the TIE fighters away with the Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.</p>\r\n<p>Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable surviving Resistance members to escape. Kylo orders the First Orders forces to fire on Luke to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection of him.

However, the government is more concerned with the amount of collateral damage caused by the incident, and shuts down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parr family without financial assistance from the head of the program, Rick Dicker. That night, Lucius informs Bob and Helen of an offer presented to him by Winston Deavor, a superhero fan and the owner of DevTech, a telecommunications corporation. Winston and his sister Evelyn, the genius inventor behind DevTech technology, propose a publicity stunt to regain the publics support and trust in Supers.</p>\r\n<p>Helen is chosen to spearhead the stunt under her old superhero identity, Elastigirl.

Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl investigates further and realizes that the Screenslaver was being controlled by screens within his goggles. Before she can alert anyone, however, Evelyn forces the goggles onto her, revealing herself as the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that her hatred for Supers stems from her parents murder several years ago, where instead of hiding from intruders and calling the police, her father attempted to call the Supers, but was unable to reach them and fatally shot. Evelyn plans to use the Supers to sabotage her brothers summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish their reputation forever.

They subdue the ships crew members and aim the high-speed ship at Municiberg before Bob destroys the controls. When the Parr children find them, Jack-Jack telekinetically removes the goggles from Elastigirl, who in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone.

While cleaning R2-D2, Luke accidentally triggers part of Leias message, in which she requests help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. The next morning, Luke finds R2-D2 missing, and meets Ben Kenobi, an old hermit who lives in the hills, and reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan tells Luke of his days as one of the Jedi Knights, former Galactic Republic peacekeepers with supernatural powers derived from an energy called the Force, who were all but wiped out by the Empire. Contrary to his uncles statements, Luke learns that his father fought alongside Obi-Wan as a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan tells Luke that Vader was his former pupil, who turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered Lukes father. Obi-Wan then presents to Luke his fathers weapon &ndash; a lightsaber.</p>\r\n<p>Obi-Wan views Leias complete message, in which she begs him to take the Death Star plans to her home planet of Alderaan and give them to her father for analysis. Obi-Wan invites Luke to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force. Luke declines, but changes his mind after discovering that Imperial stormtroopers have destroyed the moisture farm, killing his aunt and uncle. Obi-Wan and Luke travel to Mos Eisley, where they meet smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee first mate Chewbacca at a Cantina. They join forces and board the Millennium Falcon.</p>\r\n<p>Upon the Falcons arrival at the location of Alderaan, the group discovers that the planet has been destroyed by the Death Stars superlaser on order of the commanding officer, Grand Moff Tarkin, as a show of power. The Falcon is captured by the Death Stars tractor beam, and brought into its hangar bay. While Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, Luke discovers that Leia is imprisoned aboard, and with the help of Han and Chewbacca, Luke rescues her. After several escapes, the group makes its way back to the Falcon. On the way back to the Falcon, Obi-Wan engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. To ensure the rest of the team escapes the Death Star alive, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself at the hands of Darth Vader. The Falcon escapes from the Death Star, unknowingly carrying a tracking beacon, which the Empire follows to the Rebels hidden base on Yavin IV.</p>\r\n<p>The Rebels analyze the Death Stars plans and identify a vulnerable exhaust port that connects to the stations main reactor, and that the Death Star can be destroyed through a chain reaction. Luke joins the Rebels squadron, while Han collects his payment for the transport and intends to leave, despite Lukes request that he should stay and help. In the ensuing battle, the Rebels suffer heavy losses after several unsuccessful attack runs, leaving Luke as one of the few surviving pilots. Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and prepares to attack Lukes X-wing fighter, but Han returns and fires at the Imperials, sending Vader spiraling away. Helped by guidance from Obi-Wans spirit, Luke uses the Force to destroy the Death Star seconds before it can fire on the Rebel base. Back on Yavin IV, Leia awards Luke and Han with medals for their heroism.</p>\r\n', 'images/posters/Star Wars Ep.

When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving one of their own behind in their haste. At a suburban home in the San Fernando Valley, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his familys disbelief, Elliott leaves Reeses Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its planetary system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.</p>\r\n<p>The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches Sesame Street and, at Elliotts urging, dubs itself \"E.T.\" E.T. reads a comic strip where Buck Rogers, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliotts help in building a device to \"phone home\" by using a Speak &amp; Spell toy. Michael notices that E.T.s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as \"we\".</p>\r\n<p>On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her sons illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michaels friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.</p>\r\n<p>Standing near the spaceship, E.T.s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and \"Keys\", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he tells Elliott \"Ill be right here\", pointing his glowing finger to Elliotts forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.</p>\r\n', 'images/posters/ET The ExtraTerrestrial.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7-2PB4jj2o\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 792965326),

King Mufasas newborn son, Simba, is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a mandrill)[3] who serves as shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\" which connects all living things. Mufasas younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala&mdash;to whom Simba is betrothed&mdash;into exploring a forbidden elephants graveyard, where they are attacked by three spotted hyenas who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.</p>\r\n<p>Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simbas peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorges edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simbas own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.</p>\r\n<p>Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scars reign. Feeling guilty over his fathers death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasas spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return home.</p>\r\n<p>Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts him over his role in Mufasas death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.</p>\r\n<p>Later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Rafiki presents Simba and Nalas newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.</p>\r\n', 'images/posters/The Lion King.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sj1MT05lAA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 987413217),

Daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana was raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus to protect mankind. Hippolyta shares the Amazonian history with Diana, including how Ares, Zeuss son, became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat (thus dying in the process). Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the \"Godkiller\", to prepare them for Ares return.</p>\r\n<p>Although she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, Antiope, train Diana, only more rigorously than any other warrior. In 1917, Diana, now a young woman, rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by a German light cruiser that had been pursuing Trevor. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana (by taking the bullet fired from a German sailor that was meant for Diana). Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, and reveals that a great war is consuming the outside world and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas, under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff from a weapon facility in the Ottoman Empire. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"Godkiller\" sword, the lasso, and her armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.</p>\r\n<p>In London, they deliver Marus notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Marus notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in Belgium. Diana goes alone through No Mans Land and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, while Diana and Steve grow closer romantically.</p>\r\n<p>The team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.</p>\r\n<p>Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"Godkiller\" sword, he destroys it, then reveals Diana to be the \"Godkiller\", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steves team destroys Marus laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to direct Dianas rage and grief at Steves death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve and reaffirms her new mission to fight and give on the worlds behalf.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/wonder-woman.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lGoQhFb4NM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 821563408),

In the present day, approximately one year after Ultrons defeat in the nation of Sokovia at the hands of the Avengers, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically contains the explosion and throws it upward, damaging a nearby building and killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers.</p>\r\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultrons creation and Sokovias devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes brainwashing. At a conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King TChaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom TChakas son, TChalla, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes whereabouts and the authorities intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes&mdash;his childhood friend and war comrade&mdash;himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from TChalla and the authorities, but all four, including TChalla, are apprehended.</p>\r\n<p>Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed \"Winter Soldiers\" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Rosss permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, TChalla, James Rhodes, Vision, and Peter Parker to capture the renegades. Starks team intercepts Rogers group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. The rest of Rogers team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff goes into exile.</p>\r\n<p>Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by TChalla. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Starks parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes robotic arm, and Rogers disables Starks armor. He departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his familys deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by TChalla and taken to the authorities.</p>\r\n<p>In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found.

Alex sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a video game cartridge which catches Alexs attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drums and he is transported into the game.</p>\r\n<p>Twenty years later, in 2016, four Brantford High School students serve detention: Spencer Gilpin, caught writing an essay for former friend Anthony \"Fridge\" Johnson (also in detention); Bethany Walker, who made a video call during an English-class quiz and Martha Kaply, who refused to participate in gym class. They are sent to the school basement to prepare magazines for recycling and to think about their future. Fridge discovers Alexs discarded video-game system when he explores the basement, and he and Spencer set up the game. Although it has five playable characters, the first one cannot be selected. Spencer and Fridge choose two characters, and the girls choose their own. When Spencer presses \"Start\", they are transported into the game.</p>\r\n<p>They are in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is tough, muscular explorer and archaeologist Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is diminutive zoologist Franklin \"Mouse\" Finbar, whom he chose after misreading \"Mouse\" as \"Moose\"; Bethany is chubby male cartographer and intellectual Sheldon \"Shelly\" Oberon (whose nickname she mistook for a womans), and Martha is beautiful commando and martial arts expert Ruby Roundhouse. They each have three lives; Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they really die.</p>\r\n<p>They learn the games story from NPC Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguars Eye (a magic jewel) from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a jaguar statue and call \"Jumanji\" to lift the curse. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanjis animals. They begin tackling the games increasingly-difficult \"levels\", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex (the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough). Taking shelter in a jungle house built by Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a helicopter to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of white rhinoceros. Spencer uses one of Fridges lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR and transfers one of her lives to him.</p>\r\n<p>At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelts forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha (trapped in a pit of mambas) and demands the jewel, but she sacrifices one of her lives to re-spawn and get it to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of rats and return to the real world; Nigel bids them farewell, but Alex does not appear with them. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, returning to where he left off in 1996.

While she is at work during the day, he hangs out with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe, pug Mel, dachshund Buddy, and budgerigar Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, a large mongrel from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided focus on Duke. Enraged by Maxs attitude towards him, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone who removes both dogs collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control. Duke fears that he will be killed if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white Pomeranian who is (not so) secretly in love with Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.</p>\r\n<p>Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of \"The Flushed Pets\"&mdash;a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty by allowing a one-fanged viper to bite them, Snowball learns from the cats that Max and Duke are domesticated. The two dogs escape the sewers and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Gidget recruits a red-tailed hawk named Tiberius to find Max, but he mistakenly locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, guinea pig Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old Basset Hound who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke raid a sausage factory for food. Then, Gidget and her team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidgets team flees.</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. Max convinces him to visit Freds house in a nearby neighborhood, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. When they arrive at Freds house, they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.</p>\r\n<p>While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a city bus into the van on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max, unaware of his partnership with Snowball, but Gidget and her team save him. Upon seeing Gidget using her kung-fu fighting skills, and Max starts to fall in love with her. The van gets stuck in scaffolding and the Flushed Pets escape. As soon as Max gets the keys to Dukes cage, the van plummets into the East River with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve the keys, allowing them to escape the sinking van.</p>\r\n<p>The entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a little girl named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball and the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet. The other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship.

Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela disapproves of him using human tricks like building tools instead of learning the ways of the pack.</p>\r\n<p>One day, during the dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungles wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a scarred tiger named Shere Khan arrives, detecting Mowglis scent in the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.</p>\r\n<p>En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous python named Kaa who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan. The vision also warns of the destructive power of the \"red flower\" (fire). Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a large brown sloth bear named Baloo, rescuing an unconscious Mowgli. Baloo and Mowgli bond while retrieving some difficult-to-access honey for Baloo, and the boy agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.</p>\r\n<p>Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is angered that Mowgli has not joined the humans as agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of Indian elephants gathered around a ditch and uses his vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are both impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowglis safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.</p>\r\n<p>Mowgli is kidnapped by the \"Bandar-log\" (monkeys) who present him to their leader, a giant ape named King Louie. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak him out, but their plan is discovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akelas death. King Louies rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him. Furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him about Akelas death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone.</p>\r\n<p>Mowgli steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tigers weight and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.</p>\r\n<p>In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack.

After successfully collecting a bone fragment, the teams survivors barely escape the island following attacks by the Mosasaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>\r\n<p>Three years later in 2018, a U.S. Senate hearing in Washington, D.C. debates whether Isla Nublars dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct John Hammonds mistake of cloning them. Meanwhile, Jurassic Worlds former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has created the dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammonds former partner, Benjamin Lockwood, summons Claire to his Northern California estate. Lockwood and his aide, Eli Mills, reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to help reactivate the parks dinosaur tracking system to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last living Velociraptor. Although they are estranged, Claire recruits Jurassic Worlds former Velociraptor trainer and Blues alpha, Owen Grady, to help capture her.</p>\r\n<p>On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician Franklin Webb get the tracking system online. Owen, paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez, and a mercenary team led by Ken Wheatley search for Blue. Upon finding her, the encounter escalates, resulting in a mercenary shooting Blue and Wheatley tranquilizing Owen. The mercenaries take Zia so she can treat Blues injury. Their ship departs for the U.S. mainland as the animals left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard in time and assist Zia in transfusing Blue with Tyrannosaurus blood. The group now realize the captured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island and are for another purpose.</p>\r\n<p>Back at the estate, Lockwoods orphaned pre-teen granddaughter Maisie overhears Mills and auctioneer Gunnar Eversol secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the black market. They will also unveil the Indoraptor, a new genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu using Indominus rex and Velociraptor DNA. Wu wants Blues DNA to create an enhanced Indoraptor, unaware that Blues blood is contaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwoods deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed human cloning, ended their partnership.</p>\r\n<p>The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwoods estate and caged. Zia and Franklin evade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended and confined. Owen incites a Stygimoloch into breaking open their cell. They find Maisie who leads them to the auction where the Indoraptor is being sold despite Wus protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the event by luring the Stygimoloch into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the Indoraptor to extract a tooth as a trophy, but it feigns sedation and escapes, killing him, Eversol, and others. The Indoraptor hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia releases Blue, who attacks the Indoraptor, causing it to fall through a glass roof to its death.</p>\r\n<p>When a hydrogen cyanide gas leak threatens the caged animals, Maisie is unable to let them die and frees them despite Owens warning.

Despite being the academy valedictorian, Judy is delegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.</p>\r\n<p>The next day, Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of crocus bulbs known as Midnicampum holicithias. Bogo reprimands her, but an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogos office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who are missing. When Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment, Bogo has no choice but to let Judy take the case. He gives her 48 hours to find Emmitt Otterton on the condition that if she fails, she resigns.</p>\r\n<p>Judy blackmails Nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion, having ascertained from the last-sighting photo of Otterton that Nick was the last to see him. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went \"savage\"&mdash;reverted to a feral state&mdash;and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about \"night howlers\" before the attack. Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but when they arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands Judys resignation, but Nick reminds Bogo that Judy still has ten hours to solve the case.</p>\r\n<p>At City Hall, Bellwether offers Judy and Nick access to the citys traffic cameras.

However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior, and her comments cause tension between predators and prey throughout the city. Feeling guilty for the results of her words, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.</p>\r\n<p>Back in Bunnyburrow, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and that they have severe psychotropic effects on mammals, causing them to go savage. After returning to Zootopia and reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who tells them the bulbs he stole were for a ram named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway, developing a drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun.</p>\r\n<p>Judy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and takes the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibition after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him kill Judy and summons the ZPD for help, but Judy and Nick have replaced the serum pellets in Bellwethers gun with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame the pair for the attacks, but Judy has covertly recorded Bellwethers confession.

He is awakened from his dream by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who warns him of Lois Lanes crucial role in the future, and urges him to find \"the others\" before vanishing. Upon fully decrypting the drive, Wayne discovers Luthors files on several metahuman individuals across the globe. One of them is Prince herself, who is shown in a photo taken during World War I. Wayne admits to Alfred Pennyworth that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.</p>\r\n<p>At a Congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb smuggled by Luthor goes off and kills everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite, planning to use it to battle Superman by building a powered exoskeleton, creating a kryptonite grenade launcher, and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and accesses a vast technology database accumulated from over 100,000 worlds.</p>\r\n<p>To bring Superman out of exile, Luthor kidnaps Lois and Martha Kent, Clarks adoptive mother. He reveals to him that he manipulated Superman and Batman by fueling their distrust for each other. Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in exchange for Marthas life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman attacks Superman and eventually subdues him. Before Batman can kill Superman with the spear, Superman urges Batman to \"save Martha\", whose name is also shared with Bruces late mother and whose own father echoed a similar sentiment before dying. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.</p>\r\n<p>Luthor executes his backup plan, unleashing a genetically engineered monster with DNA from both Zods body and his own blood. Diana Prince arrives unexpectedly; revealing her metahuman nature, she joins forces with Batman and Superman to eliminate the creature. When they are all outmatched, Superman realizes its vulnerability to kryptonite, and retrieves the spear to kill it. In the creatures last moments, it fatally wounds Superman.</p>\r\n<p>Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Supermans death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, with various friends and family members including Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince attending his funeral in Smallville. Martha gives an envelope to Lois, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Bruce expresses his regrets to Diana about how he failed Superman. He reveals to her that he plans to form a team of metahumans, starting with those from Luthors files, to help protect the world in Supermans absence. After they leave, the dirt atop Clarks coffin levitates.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/Batman-v-Superman.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IwfUnkBfdZ4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 868160194),

Due to leg braces fitted to correct a curved spine, Forrest is unable to walk properly. One day, a young truck driver stays at the boarding house that Forrest lives in with his mother. The young truck driver turns out to be Elvis Presley, who, while playing guitar for him, becomes enthralled at the jerky hip thrusting movements that the hobbled Forrest makes while trying to dance. Later on, Elvis becomes famous by imitating the dance.</p>\r\n<p>Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and marginal intelligence. One day, while trying to escape some bullies chasing him, his braces fall off revealing the young Forrest to be a very fast runner. Jenny yells to him, \"Run, Forrest, run!\" Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrests new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in 1963, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the U.S. Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves many of his platoon, including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs. Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism.</p>\r\n<p>While Forrest is in recovery for a gunshot wound to his buttocks received while saving his platoon-mates, he discovers a talent for ping pong. He becomes a ping pong celebrity and plays competitively against Chinese teams in ping pong diplomacy. At an anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., Forrest briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. While in D.C. in 1972, Forrest meets president Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate hotel, where he accidentally reveals the Watergate scandal, ultimately forcing Nixon to resign.</p>\r\n<p>Returning home, Forrest endorses a company that makes ping pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane Carmen they pull in huge amounts of shrimp. They use their income to purchase a fleet of shrimp boats. Dan invests the money in Apple Computer (which Forrest na&iuml;vely thinks is \"some kind of fruit company\") and Forrest is financially secure for the rest of his life but gives half of his earnings to Bubbas family. He then returns home to see his mothers last days.</p>\r\n<p>In late 1978, Jenny returns to visit Forrest, and he soon proposes to her. She declines but slips into his bedroom and makes love to him that night before leaving early the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest elects to go for a run. He decides to keep running across the country several times over three and a half years, becoming famous in the process.</p>\r\n<p>In the present, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny who, having seen him run on television, asked him to visit her. Reunited with Jenny, she introduces him to his son, named Forrest Gump, Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown virus. The three then move back to Greenbow.

Georgie sails the boat along the rainy streets of small town Derry, and is disappointed when it falls down a storm drain. As he attempts to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the sewer, who introduces himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. The clown entices Georgie to come closer, then severs his arm and drags him into the sewer.</p>\r\n<p>The following summer, Bill and his friends&mdash;Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stan Uris&mdash;run afoul of older bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Bill, still haunted by Georgies disappearance and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brothers body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to investigate, believing his brother may still be alive. Ben Hanscom learns that the town has been plagued by unexplained tragedies and child disappearances for centuries. He is targeted by Bowers gang, after which he flees into the Barrens and meets Bills group. They find the sneaker of a missing girl, while a member of the pursuing Bowers Gang, Patrick Hockstetter, is killed by Pennywise while searching the sewers for Ben.</p>\r\n<p>Beverly Marsh, a girl ostracized over rumors of promiscuity, also joins the group; both Bill and Ben develop feelings for her. Later, the group befriends Mike Hanlon after defending him from Bowers. All the while each member of the group has encountered terrifying phenomena in various forms; these include the same menacing clown who attacked Georgie, a headless boy, a fountain of blood, a diseased and rotting man, a creepy painting come to life, Mikes parents burning alive, and a phantom Georgie.</p>\r\n<p>Now calling themselves \"The Losers Club\", they realize they are all being terrorized by the same entity. They determine that \"It\" assumes the appearance of what they fear, awakens every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before returning to hibernation, and moves about by using sewer lines, which all lead to a well currently under the abandoned house at 29 Neibolt Street. After an attack by Pennywise, the group ventures to the house to confront him, only to be separated and terrorized. Eddie breaks his arm, while Pennywise gloats to Bill about Georgie. As they regroup, Beverly impales Pennywise through the head, forcing the clown to retreat. After the encounter, the group begins to splinter, with only Bill and Beverly resolute in fighting It.</p>\r\n<p>Weeks later, after Beverly confronts and incapacitates her sexually abusive father, she is abducted by Pennywise. The Losers Club reassembles and travels back to the Neibolt house to rescue her. Henry Bowers, who has killed his father after being compelled into madness by It, attacks the group. Mike fights back and pushes Bowers down the well to his apparent death. The Losers descend into the sewers and find Its underground lair, which contains a mountain of decayed circus props and childrens belongings, around which the bodies of missing children float in mid-air. Beverly, now catatonic after being exposed to Its true form, is restored to consciousness as Ben kisses her. Bill encounters Georgie, but recognizes that he is Pennywise in disguise. Pennywise attacks the group and takes Bill hostage, offering to spare the others if they let It keep Bill. The Losers reject this and reaffirm their friendship, overcoming their various fears. After a brief battle, they defeat Pennywise and it retreats, with Bill declaring that It will starve during its hibernation. Bill finally accepts his brothers death and is comforted by his friends.</p>\r\n<p>As summer ends, Beverly informs the group of a vision she had while catatonic, where she saw them fighting the creature as adults. The Losers create a blood oath by cutting each others hands and forming a circle, swearing to return to Derry in adulthood if It returns and destroy the creature once and for all. Stanley, Eddie, Richie, Mike, and Ben make their goodbyes as the group part ways. Beverly tells Bill she is leaving the next day to live with her aunt in Portland.

The team consists of elite hitman Deadshot, former psychiatrist Harley Quinn, pyrokinetic ex-gangster El Diablo, opportunistic thief Captain Boomerang, genetic mutant Killer Croc, and specialized assassin Slipknot. They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nano bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape.</p>\r\n<p>One of Wallers intended recruits is Flags girlfriend Dr. June Moone, an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the \"Enchantress\". Enchantress quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is Katana, a Japanese swordswoman.</p>\r\n<p>Harleys homicidal lover Joker finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nano bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harleys bomb. On approach, the squads helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang inaccurately convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check; Slipknot attempts to escape and Flag kills him via his nano bomb, while the squad is attacked by Enchantress minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe room, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress siege.</p>\r\n<p>The squad escorts Waller to a rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harleys bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allows her to climb aboard the helicopter. Wallers men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Wallers whereabouts, Enchantress minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Wallers confidential files and learns the truth about Enchantress. Flag is then forced to confess the truth, causing the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of Navy SEALs, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.</p>\r\n<p>The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges. The Joker, alive and unscathed, breaks into the penitentiary and rescues Harley.</p>\r\n<p>In a mid-credits scene, Waller meets with Bruce Wayne, who agrees to protect her from the backlash against her role in Enchantress rampage in exchange for access to the governments files on the expanding metahuman community while telling her to shut down Task Force X or else he and his \"friends\" will do it.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/Suicide Squad.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmRih_VtVAs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 746100054),

His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into a Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, delivered by a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid explains Harrys hidden past as the wizard son of James and Lily Potter, who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort, which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. The strangest bit of the murder was how Voldemort was unable to kill him, but instead had his own powers removed and blasted away, sparking Harrys immense fame among the magical community.</p>\r\n<p>Hagrid introduces Harry to the wizarding world, bringing him to places such as Diagon Alley, a hidden London street where Harry gets his owl Hedwig and various school supplies, and Gringotts Wizarding Bank, where he uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents in his vault. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards.</p>\r\n<p>A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys home to catch the Hogwarts Express from Kings Cross railway stations secret Hogwarts platform, Platform 9&frac34;. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, Draco Malfoy, who shows prejudice against Ron for his familys financial difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>Arriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical Sorting Hat to Houses that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherins dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his whole family before him.</p>\r\n<p>As classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers his innate talent for flying on broomsticks despite no prior experience, and is recruited into his Houses Quidditch (a competitive wizards sport played in the air) team as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the schools Potions master, Severus Snape, who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her attempts to stop them fail and the Fat Lady (a portrayed woman guarding the entrance to the Gryffindor rooms) had left her picture. Harry, Ron, and Hermione then find Neville asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password. When they arrive in the trophy room Malfoy is not there and Filch is already there looking for them. They run away and eventually run into a locked door that Hermione opens with a simple spell. This also causes the discovery of a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor by Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville. The peaceful school year is interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls bathroom where Hermione was crying due to Ron saying that she is &ldquo;a nightmare come true&rdquo;. However she is saved by Harry and Ron (who arrive on time) and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snapes recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.</p>\r\n<p>Hermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear for expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape is jinxing Harrys broom due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas approaches and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harrys father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate the possibility of what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true.</p>\r\n<p>A visit to Hagrids cottage at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault&mdash;the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when Harry was getting his school items. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a Philosophers Stone, which grants its user immortality as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Harry is also informed by a centaur named Firenze in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the schools headmaster Albus Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.</p>\r\n<p>They encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, and one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizards chess. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school. Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead, who had wronged him. Now, Quirrell is partly possessed by Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrells head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban. Voldemort needs Harrys help to get past the final obstacle: the Mirror of Erised, forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harrys lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boys skin, and Quirrell burns alive.</p>\r\n<p>Harry awakes in the schools infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort to be owed to his mothers sacrifice for him to live, leaving a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, burning Quirrell, a being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his fathers invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell them that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone-movie.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/geNlXmmIp7w\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 974755371),

Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, infusing into it a great part of his power to dominate, through it and at a distance, the other Rings, so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of men and elves battles Sauron&rsquo;s forces in Mordor, where Prince Isildur of Gondor severs Saurons finger, and the Ring with it, thereby destroying his physical form. With Saurons first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. Unfortunately, the Rings influence corrupts Isildur, and, rather than destroy the Ring, Isildur takes it for himself. Isildur is later killed by Orcs, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.</p>\r\n<p>Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo reveals that he intends to leave the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew, Frodo. Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted by the Ring and tries to keep it for himself, Gandalf intervenes. Gandalf, suspicious of the Ring, tells Frodo to keep it secret and to keep it safe. Gandalf then investigates the Ring, discovers its true identity, and returns to warn Frodo. Gandalf also learns that Gollum was tortured by Orcs, and that Gollum uttered two words during his torture: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with fellow wizard Saruman the White, but learns that he has joined forces with Sauron, who has unleashed the Ringwraiths to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrives, and they are instead aided by a ranger named Strider, a friend of Gandalfs, who escorts them to Rivendell.</p>\r\n<p>The Hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, and one stabs Frodo with a cursed Morgul blade. Arwen, an elf and Strider&rsquo;s lover, comes to Frodo&rsquo;s aid and successfully takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed. Frodo meets Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on the back of a giant Eagle. Arwen&rsquo;s father, Lord Elrond, holds a council that decides the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While the members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf Legolas, dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur&rsquo;s heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman&rsquo;s magic forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, much to Gandalfs displeasure.</p>\r\n<p>The Fellowship discovers that the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and they are attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They defeat them, but are confronted by an ancient demon called a Balrog. Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but it drags Gandalf down into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now commanded by Aragorn, reaches Lothl&oacute;rien, home to elves Galadriel and Celeborn. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest, and that one of his friends will try to take the Ring.

Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to take the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone. The Fellowship is then ambushed by the Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain. After slaying the chieftain, Aragorn watches Boromir die peacefully.

He blames himself for her death and attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by Colossus. Wilson is left with only a Skee-Ball token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.</p>\r\n<p>Recovering at the X-Mansion, Wilson agrees to join the X-Men as a form of healing. He, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Russell Collins / Firefist at an orphanage, labeled a \"Mutant Reeducation Center\". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, a cybernetic soldier from the future, Cable, whose family is murdered by an older Collins, travels back in time to kill the boy before Collins ever becomes a killer.</p>\r\n<p>Cable breaks into the Ice Box and attacks Collins.

Seeing this sacrifice, Collins does not kill the headmaster; this changes the future so that Cables family now survives. Cable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessas token in front of Wilsons heart.

Surtur reveals that Thors father Odin is no longer on Asgard, and that the realm will soon be destroyed in the prophesied Ragnar&ouml;k, once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odins vault. Thor frees himself and defeats Surtur and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnar&ouml;k.</p>\r\n<p>Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall gone and his brother Loki posing as Odin. After exposing Loki, Thor forces him to help find their father, and with directions from Stephen Strange on Earth, they locate Odin in Norway. Odin explains that he is dying and Ragnar&ouml;k is imminent despite Thor&rsquo;s efforts to prevent it. He then reveals his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela was the leader of Asgards armies, conquering the Nine Realms with Odin, but Odin imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after he feared that she had become too ambitious and powerful. Odin then dies and Hela appears, destroying Thors hammer Mjolnir. She pursues Thor and Loki as they attempt to flee through the Bifr&ouml;st Bridge, forcing them out into space. Hela arrives in Asgard, defeating its army and killing the Warriors Three. She then resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf Fenris, and appoints the Asgardian Skurge as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifr&ouml;st to expand Asgards empire, but Heimdall takes the sword that controls the Bridge and begins hiding other Asgardians.</p>\r\n<p>Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes. A slave trader designated Scrapper 142 subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a gladiator to Sakaars ruler, the Grandmaster, with whom Loki has already ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as one of the Valkyrior, a legendary force of female warriors who were killed fighting Hela long ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmasters Contest of Champions, facing his old friend Hulk. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulks victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing. He soon manages to escape the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Natasha Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia.</p>\r\n<p>The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, but the pair come to blows and Loki forces her to relive the deaths of her fellow Valkyrior at the hands of Hela. Deciding to help Thor, she takes Loki captive. Unwilling to be left behind, Loki provides the group with the means to steal one of the Grandmasters ships. They then liberate the other gladiators who, led by Korg and Miek, stage a revolution. Loki attempts to again betray his brother to the Grandmaster, but Thor anticipates this and leaves him behind, where Korg and the gladiators soon find him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Helas forces are attacking Heimdall and the remaining Asgardians in pursuit of the sword that controls the Bifr&ouml;st. Banner becomes Hulk again, defeating Fenris, while Thor and 142 battle Hela and her warriors. Loki and the gladiators arrive to rescue the citizens. A repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to enable their escape. Thor, facing Hela, loses his right eye and then has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnar&ouml;k can stop her. He sends Loki to retrieve Surturs crown and place it in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, seemingly killing Hela.</p>\r\n<p>Aboard the Grandmasters spaceship, Thor, now king, decides to take his people to Earth.

David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the Oval Office and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Whitmore orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.</p>\r\n<p>On July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their air forces attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, a F/A-18 jet pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Whitmores group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.</p>\r\n<p>When eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks. It telepathically invades Dr. Okuns mind and uses his vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore before launching a psychic attack against him. Whitmore sees visions of the aliens plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and stripping the planet of all natural resources. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien, Whitmore reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a B-2 Spirit fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above Houston, but the saucer remains intact.</p>\r\n<p>On July 4, David demonstrates that the key to defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, blowing it to pieces. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. With the aliens shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to effectively fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can bring down the ship. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile fails, he bravely rams his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing a chain reaction that destroys the entire ship. Human resistance forces around the world are informed of the alien ships weak point, and successfully destroy the other saucers. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earths atmosphere.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/Independence Day.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kA2WzBi2grE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 817400878),

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. A young man then appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself.</p>\r\n<p>The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, nine-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincents. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Coles mother, Lynn worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe in the iconic line: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.</p>\r\n<p>At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, Vincent begins crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability. He suggests to Cole that he should try to find a purpose for his gift by communicating with the ghosts and perhaps aid them with their unfinished business. At first, Cole is unwilling since the ghosts terrify and sometimes even threaten him, but he finally decides to attempt helping.</p>\r\n<p>Cole talks to one of the ghosts, a young girl named Kyra who recently died after a chronic illness. He goes with Crowe to her funeral reception at her home, where Kyra directs him to a box holding a videotape, which he then gives to her father. The tape shows Kyras mother poisoning her daughters food. By proving she was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, Cole has saved Kyras younger sister, the mothers next victim.</p>\r\n<p>Learning to live with the ghosts he sees, Cole begins to fit in at school and is cast as the lead in the school play, which Crowe attends. The doctor and patient depart on positive terms and Cole suggests to Crowe that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep. Later, while stuck in traffic, Cole confesses his secret to his mother, saying that someone died in an accident ahead of their traffic and he knows because the person is next to him. Although his mother at first does not believe him, Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him. He describes how his grandmother saw his mother in a dance performance, even though Lynn thought her mother was not there. He further relays the answer to a question his mother privately asked at her mothers grave: \"Every day.\" When Cole asks what question she asked, his mother tearfully answers, \"Do I make her proud?\" They hug.</p>\r\n<p>Crowe returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing. While still asleep, Anna asks her husband why he left her, and drops Crowes wedding ring, which he suddenly discovers he has not been wearing. He remembers what Cole said about ghosts and realizes that he has actually been dead the whole time, having been killed by Vincent. Because of Coles efforts, Crowes unfinished business &ndash; rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent &ndash; is finally complete. Crowe fulfills the second reason he returned; to tell his wife she was never second, and that he loves her. His goal complete, he is free to leave the world of the living.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>', 'images/posters/The Sixth Sense.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VG9AGf66tXM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 672806292),

The rebels, led by Princess Leia, have set up a new base on the ice planet Hoth. The Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, continues to hunt for the Rebels new base by dispatching probe droids across the galaxy. Luke Skywalker is captured by a wampa while investigating one such probe, but he manages to escape from the wampas cave with his lightsaber. Before Luke succumbs to the freezing temperatures, the spirit of his late mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the Dagobah system to train under Jedi Master Yoda. Luke is found by Han Solo, where they cut open a Tauntaun (that Han rode on) to keep warm inside, and the duo is eventually rescued by a search party.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the rebels location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack, using AT-AT Walkers to capture the base, which forces the rebels to retreat. Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon with C-3PO and Chewbacca, but the ships hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer and eventually kiss. Vader summons bounty hunters to assist in finding the Falcon. Luke, meanwhile, escapes with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter and crash-lands on the swamp planet Dagobah. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wans spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his student.</p>\r\n<p>After evading the Imperial fleet, Hans group travel to the floating Cloud City on the planet of Bespin, which is run by Hans old friend, Lando Calrissian. Unbeknownst to the group, the bounty hunter Boba Fett tracks the Falcon; shortly after their arrival, Lando leads the group into a trap and they are handed over to Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure out Luke, intending to capture him alive and take him to Emperor Palpatine. Luke sees a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them.</p>\r\n<p>Vader intends to hold Luke in suspended animation via carbon freezing and selects Han to be frozen as a test subject. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who intends to deliver Han to Jabba the Hutt. Lando initiates an escape and frees Leia and the others, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Han. They fight their way back to the Falcon and flee Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke arrives at Cloud City and engages with Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the citys central air shaft. Vader severs Lukes right hand, disarming him; when Luke refuses to join Vader against the Emperor, accusing him of murdering his father, Vader reveals that he, in fact, is his father. Horrified by the truth, Luke intentionally falls into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he grabs onto an antenna. He makes a telepathic plea to Leia, who senses it and persuades Lando to return for him in the Falcon. After Luke is brought on board, they are chased by TIE fighters and Vader on his star destroyer, but R2-D2 reactivates the Falcons hyperdrive, allowing them to escape.</p>\r\n<p>Aboard a medical frigate in the Rebel fleet, Lukes severed hand is replaced with a robotic hand.

Waternoose, is determined to find a solution.</p>\r\n<p>James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan and his partner, Mike Wazowski, are the organizations top employees, but their chief rival, Randall Boggs, is close behind.

After several failed attempts to put her back, Randall sends the door back into the factorys door vault and Sulley conceals her and takes her out of the factory. He interrupts Mikes date with his girlfriend, Celia, at a sushi restaurant, and chaos erupts when the child is discovered. Sulley and Mike manage to escape with the child before the Child Detection Agency (CDA) quarantines the restaurant. They soon discover that she is not toxic after all; Sulley grows attached to her and calls her \"Boo,\" while Mike is just anxious to be rid of her.</p>\r\n<p>The duo smuggle her back into the factory disguised as a baby monster in an attempt to send her home. Randall discovers Boo and tries to kidnap her, but mistakenly kidnaps Mike instead. He straps Mike to a large machine called \"The Scream Extractor\", which he intends to use to revolutionize the scaring industry and solve the monster worlds energy problems by forcefully extracting screams from kidnapped human children. Before Randall can use the machine on Mike, Sulley disables the machine, frees Mike and reports Randall to Waternoose. Waternoose, who is secretly in league with Randall, initially indicates anger at hearing of Randalls actions, but instead exiles Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas after revealing he is involved in Randalls plot. The two meet the Abominable Snowman, who tells them about a nearby village, which Sulley realizes he can use to return to the factory. Sulley prepares to return, but Mike refuses to go with him.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Randall is preparing to use the Scream Extractor on Boo, but Sulley suddenly arrives and saves her, destroying the machine in the process. Randall and Sulley battle, and after Mike returns and helps Sulley overpower Randall, the two reconcile, take Boo, and flee.</p>\r\n<p>Randall pursues them to the door vault, and a wild chase ensues among the millions of doors as they move in and out of the storage vault on rails to the factory floor. Boos laughter causes all the doors to activate at once, allowing the monsters to freely pass in and out of the human world. Randall attempts to kill Sulley, but Boo overcomes her fear and attacks him, enabling Sulley to catch him. Sulley and Mike then trap Randall in the human world, where two residents at a trailer park mistake him for an alligator and beat him with a shovel.</p>\r\n<p>Sulley and Mike take Boo and her door to the training room. Waternoose appears and demands Sulley surrender Boo to him. Sulley inadvertently baits Waternoose into shouting \"Ill kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die, and Ill silence anyone who gets in my way\"; the confession is videotaped by Mike, who then plays the recording to the CDA, who quickly arrest and imprison Waternoose. Roz appears, revealing herself to be the CDAs director who worked for nearly three years to expose Waternoose as a fraud and kidnapper. She thanks Mike and Sulley for revealing his true colors, but orders the CDA to destroy Boos door; they do so and Sulley is left saddened by Boos departure.</p>\r\n<p>With the factory temporarily shut down, Sulley is named the new CEO of Monsters, Inc.

She is hesitant to contribute, but agrees to see a private screening of the show.</p>\r\n<p>Encouraged by her grandfather, Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance, but becomes his stage hand instead. When one of the acts quits, and another is injured, Meena is added as an act. The performers individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals: Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, after having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray. After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend and evicting them from her apartment, Ash is devastated and breaks down while singing her assigned song, Carly Rae Jepsens \"Call Me Maybe.\" Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of a getaway car in a heist and making the practices. When he tries to do both, he does not show up for the planned pickup in time, and his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright, and Mike, certain that the prize money is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse, and then swindles a group of bears in a card game at a nightclub.</p>\r\n<p>The day of the screening, the bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who in turn, points to Buster. The bears open the chest containing the prize money, but it is nowhere near $100,000. The glass tank full of luminescent squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks under all their weight, flooding the theater, which then comes crashing down. With the lot repossessed by Judith, Buster, who had been living in his theaters office desk, takes up residence at Eddies place (his parents pool house). Although the contestants (besides Mike, who saw Buster as a fraud) visit him and try to cheer him up, Buster is too despondent to listen to them. He tries to start over by opening a car wash, using the same bucket that his father had used to earn money for Busters theater.</p>\r\n<p>When Meena goes to the theaters rubble lot and sings Leonard Cohens \"Hallelujah,\" Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money. They perform on a makeshift stage on the lot in front of Rosita and Meenas family members. As Rosita and Gunter perform Taylor Swifts \"Shake It Off,\" more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news. Johnnys rendition of Elton Johns \"Im Still Standing\" impresses his father, who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him. Despite an interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song \"Set It All Free.\" Mike returns to the show and sings Frank Sinatras \"My Way.\" Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings Stevie Wonders \"Dont You Worry bout a Thing,\" which literally brings down the house. The show becomes a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. Nana buys the lot and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.</p>\r\n</body></html>', 'images/posters/Sing.jpg', '<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrWjjOOYxhI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>', 634953727),
